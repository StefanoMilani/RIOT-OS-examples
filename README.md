# RIOT-OS code examples

### RIOT: The friendly Operating System for the Internet of Things.
This sentence describes perfectly what [RIOT OS](https://www.riot-os.org) is, but it can be even more friendly if you can find more examples on the Internet aside from the [official documentation](https://doc.riot-os.org).

That's my goal, give you some (I hope) useful code examples, to understand how the modules/libraries of this OS work.

The examples will regard mainly **secure** communications between devices.

### List of available codes (*)

+ Public key exchange + encrypted msg exchange



Obviously, I am working to provide more and more examples ;)

That's my first "open source" experiment, so leave me feedback (especially the **bad** ones), and if you want... contribute with lines of code.



_(*) In each directory, you can find the description of the single example and how it works._
